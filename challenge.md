# Rust + Raylib Code Challenge

Create a simple interactive application using Rust and raylib that displays a candidate's basic information (e.g., name, skills, experience) in a 2D graphical format.

## Challenge Tasks

### Display Candidate Information

Show basic information: Name, skills, experience, etc.

Organize it using simple shapes (boxes, rectangles) with text and/or images.

### User Interaction
Allow users to interact (e.g., click or hover over sections) to reveal more details about the candidate (e.g., expanded skill or experience information).

### Basic Animation
Add a simple visual effect, such as smooth transitions when interacting with sections (e.g., expand/contract boxes).

### Design Only
Provide a high-level design (no implementation) that shows how the application could load candidate information from a data source or database (e.g., from a JSON file or database query). This can be described in the code or in a separate README file.

## Requirements

### Rust Features
Use structs and enums to represent the candidate's data.
Handle user input (mouse/keyboard) with raylib.
Organize the code in a clean, idiomatic way.

### Raylib Integration
Use raylib to display 2D shapes and text.
Implement clickable elements and visual responses (e.g., highlights or box expansion).

### High-Level Data Design
Propose how you would load the candidate's information from a file or database, but do not implement it. This could be described as reading from a JSON file or using a database connection.

# Submission
Provide the source code in a github repository with a README and instructions for running the project and describing the data-loading design.
